When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
The most obviouse time is when one other person or more people is(are) colaborating with me on one project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
There are cases that I have not completed my work & want just to share my final work on the remote repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork is cloning within github to take a copy of the repositories that are shared but not allowed to change in the user repository.
clone is making a copy of the repository locally & go to developing that independent from the source of clone.
Branch is to create an independent route of commits(changes) off the branch on which active commit is live.
