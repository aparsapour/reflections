When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
The most obviouse time is when one other person or more people is(are) colaborating with me on one project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
There are cases that I have not completed my work & want just to share my final work on the remote repository.
