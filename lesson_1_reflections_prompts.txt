How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
Diff makes comparison easy!

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
Very quick & good trace back!

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Pros is flexibility & amount of control over the docs.
Cons are too unnecessary comits.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Git is designed to track versions of multiple related files, while Google Docs has no concern on the related file & looks to files as a single entity!

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
#> git log ,
#> git diff older-id revert..-id  , &/^\+  , &/^\-

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
By back tracking the code to ex-commits, one may find the point of failure & this gives the confidence that point of failure could be pointed out.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
No Idea yet!
